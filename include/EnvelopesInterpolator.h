/*
    This class performs interpolation between a set of shapes, each defined by a set of points.
    Although primarily intended for audio envelope interpolation, it can be used for other purposes.

    Key considerations for interpolation:
    1. Preserving the peak of the envelope.
    2. Avoiding involuntary discontinuities.

    The interpolation is "circle-shaped," meaning any shape can be interpolated with the next and 
    previous shapes in the sequence, with the last shape connecting seamlessly to the first.
    Because the primary purpose of this class is for audio envelopes, it is assumed that
    the first and last points of each shape are zero.
