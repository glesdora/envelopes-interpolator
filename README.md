# **EnvelopesInterpolator**

`EnvelopesInterpolator` is a lightweight C++ library for interpolating between a set of shapes, such as audio envelopes. It ensures smooth and consistent transitions by avoiding discontinuities and preserving key characteristics of the curves. It also supports circular interpolation between the first and last shapes.  
The library is versatile and can be used in audio processing, data visualization, or other domains requiring seamless shape interpolation.
